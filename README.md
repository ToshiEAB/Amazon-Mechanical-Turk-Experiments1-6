Download other files from https://github.com/ToshiEAB/Amazon-Mechanical-Turk-Tutorial and then simply replace the "experimental_session" file with the one in this repo.

As mentioned in this Tutorial repo, you have to change URLs in each source code that match your server and domain name. Look for 5-consecutive asterisks (i.e., *****) in each source code where you need to change URLs. You probably need to delete the comments with the 5-consecutive asterisks because I included them in the middle of the source code, which sometimes causes an error.
