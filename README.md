# How to use

Download other files from https://github.com/ToshiEAB/Amazon-Mechanical-Turk-Tutorial and then simply replace the "experimental_session" file with the one in this repo.

As mentioned in this Tutorial repo, you have to change URLs in each source code that match your server and domain name. Look for 5-consecutive asterisks (i.e., *****) in each source code where you need to change URLs. You probably need to delete the comments with the 5-consecutive asterisks because I included them in the middle of the source code, which sometimes causes an error. 

It should be noted that the source codes for Experiments 1-5 are similar to each other and the source code in the Tutorial repo is simiar to the one for Experiment 6. This was due to the advancement in programming we've made over the cource of project. A major difference was that group assignment was completely random in Experiments 1-5 whereas the assignment was done using a list of quasi-random numbers in Experiment 6 in order to have better control over the number of participants across groups. 

Updates
2021-8-29: I revised "experimental_session" files to make it easier for readers/uders to change URLs. They are located in the same place instead of being scattered all over the place. I also revised them for a more accurate timer.

2022-4-2: I revised several JavaScript files for preventing potential bugs.
